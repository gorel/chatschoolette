        <p>
        	Meeting new people isn't always to easy, especially
        	when you're on a college campus of thousands of people!
        	Chatschoolete is here to make this just a little bit easier
        	for you! Chatschoolette will randomly assign you to a text or 
        	video chat partner exclusively from your College Campus.  
        	If the conversation goes well, you are also able to friend
        	the other user and then message them later. Registration with
        	an academic email is required so you know you won't be paired with those weirdos(ya know, like "The other guys" ;) ).
        	Now get out there and go meet some new friends!
        	Happy chatting!
        </p>
